After a hiatus of 6 weeks, I started digging back a tiny bit into FastHTML, HTMX, etc. Now that it's been released, I have a better picture of things. 

I simply cannot unsee how useless, and frankly ridiculous this demo is.

None of what I wanted to solve needs solving: it _is already_ solved!  
I just hadn't seen it. Silly me!

This repository is thus forever frozen.

Old (stupid) README [here](https://github.com/agenkit/demo-fasthtml-picocss/blob/main/README.old.md).
