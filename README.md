# FastHTML üß° Pico CSS

> ü°Ü *Demonstrating Pico CSS in FastHTML.*

This demo is a rewrite of the "Docs" section of the Pico CSS website as one (long) page of FastHTML.

You can clone this repo and run `main.py` locally through `uvicorn` :

```bash
uvicorn main:app
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - **Friendly warning: there are garbage files** in that repo, lots of drafts & experiments. It's a Work-In-Progress! (WIP)
> - I haven't been able to deploy this particular app on my Linode VPS server.  
> I've had success with other FastHTML apps, not sure what's up here.  
> **It "works on my machine", so hopefully on yours too.** I'll redo the core properly if needed eventually.  
> (I should probably look into e.g. Railway I guess, but I'm not sure which template to choose for FastHTML.)
>
> If you can help me solve/learn ASGI Python web apps deployment, feel free to reach out.  
> ‚Üí in [GH Issues](https://github.com/agenkit/demo-fasthtml-picocss/issues) or on [ùïè](https://x.com/x__kit)

> [!TIP]
> The code of `main.py` is discussed in [`/docs/main.md`](https://github.com/agenkit/demo-fasthtml-picocss/blob/main/docs/main.md)




## TL;DR

- **Unfinished** WIP. No ETA.

- It's one long web page, itself generated by one huge `main.py` file (plus some custom CSS, JS).

- Usage: classic **page search**, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> ( <kbd>‚åò</kbd> ) + <kbd>F</kbd>
  - Applies both to the web GUI and the Python file!

- (final form) About a hundred **1:1 pairs** of `HTML`¬†‚Üê‚Üí¬†`FastHTML` snippets for quick translation.

- Demonstrates **Pico CSS**,
  - which can work "classless" as well, wherein naked HTML tags are all you need for style.

- Comments warmly welcome üéìüÜòüôè ‚Üí [GH Issues](https://github.com/agenkit/demo-fasthtml-picocss/issues) or [ùïè](https://x.com/x__kit)

- Built while FastHTML was still in **beta** (June 2024), thus **may still contain errors and false information** (will be corrected eventually).  
Notably, **all HTML tags are now implemented** in FastHTML.

## How to

Clone this repo then run `main.py` with `uvicorn`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agenkit/demo-fasthtml-picocss.git
cd demo-fasthtml-picocss
uvicorn main:app
```

To quickly page-search for any concept, HTML tag, CSS class, variable, etc.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> ( <kbd>‚åò</kbd> ) + <kbd>F</kbd> 

2. Type `THING` to find `THING`s on the page.

3. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to reach the next occurrence ( `‚Üì` )

  - <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> for previous ( `‚Üë` )

Each HTML code snippet is (WIP: will be‚Ä¶) associated 1:1 to a Python FastHTML code snippet that generates it. The canonical section goes:

- Title
- \[Description\]
- Rendered example (HTML+CSS
- HTML code snippet
- FastHTML code snippet

Only the last part self-evidently differs from the Pico CSS website. Everything else should be identical.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - FastHTML snippets are missing in v0.0.1-alpha (current latest). WIP!
> - There is a noticeable gap between sections. This is normal during development. I'll revert to Pico CSS defaults after implementing section folding (`<summary>` tag).

Syntax highlighting is provided by [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/), whose defaults fit better with PicoCSS than HighlightJS for me, on top of allowing inline highlighting.


## Discussion

> [!NOTE]
> Spoiler: I don't have any great reveal about FastHTML, as I've only skimmed the surface.  
This discussion pertains to the demo itself, and spin-off projects it might help imagine.

A primary goal was to have a whole website in one plain and simple file. I like very portable things.

- Custom JS, CSS isn't embedded in the Python file, but you could.
- Alternatively, with a SQLite db file, you can trim this massive Python code to a small fraction of its current size.
- I wanted the least obfuscated, most directly visible *everything‚Äî"Show me the f\*\*\*\*ng input!"*‚Äîsuch that reading the python file is all you need, so I opted for inline strings since it's all static.  
Self-evidently, this is for learning purposes. I wouldn't *generally* recommend such heresy.


### Background story

*I did this naive rewrite as a learning exercise. Hadn't done much web for years; wanted to get my hands dirty with FastHTML, while diving deep enough into Pico CSS; and test CursorAI, my new editor‚Ä¶ All at once. The latter would prove nigh in-dis-pen-sable to 'write'‚Äîor should I say* <kbd>Tab</kbd>*‚Äîthose 4600-ish lines (never fear: most of them are sub-30 columns).  
It all took much less time that one would think, although I'll gladly admit I underestimated **greatly** the amount of work. lol. Silly me.*¬†üòÖ


### Current status

This is a side project, and summer is always busy for me (right now I'm redeploying my entire home+SOHO infra‚Ä¶ good times‚Ä¶ *not*). So sadly, no ETA for completion. I intend to use it for myself eventually, and this is just a naive 0..1 version, a static PoC for something much larger that has yet to fully take form in my head.

> [!NOTE]
> **Pre-release `v0.0.1-alpha` is a test version.**  
> 
> It has *most* of the Pico CSS Docs reimplemented, but:
> 
> - still misses critical information, (e.g., CSS variables)
> - behaviors, (e.g., switching color templates)
> - and FastHTML snippets.
> - Parts of the code may be ugly.


### Features

The single-page layout was inspired by GameFaqs, whose plain-text UX is by far the most straightforward (no boilerplate) I've ever used. It's a niche use-case: you're busy with a big main thing (game, code editor, whatever) and you just need extensive docs by the side that you can quickly query for anything and get there in seconds. GameFaqs did it in plain text; we can do better with HTML, but the principle stands.

I've yet to make all proper web features.

- Some ToC doubling as navigation.
- Folding sections,
  - with collapse all/none buttons for each \[sub\]section.
- Working anchors (I'm dumb and didn't anticipate many evidently have the same name, duh.)
- Some short code form (e.g. section numbering in the Python file) for quick search
- Fix some dynamic JS things
- Search feature with nice-enough UI to quicly glance at the desired part.




### AI generation for websites

> [!NOTE] 
> This is highly speculative. I need to run tests to know if my intuition makes sense here, and prove that current SOTA can't already do it well enough.

There's (*will be*) a total of about 100 HTML:FastHTML pairs. That's a 'functionally perfect' dataset I'd like to feed some LLMs to see if it makes them great FastHTML writers and interpreters.

Two cool goals might be

- "Any webpage to FastHTML" generates FH code from web pages
  - as a browser extension perhaps, to inspect & quickly capture any component/layout ‚Üí I've no idea how to do that (yet)
- "FastHTML to HTML" ‚Üê can LLMs replace the Fast 'core', doing what FastHTML does, output into a usable `.html` file?

Possible next step: add a "prompt" column ‚Üí user input that produces the FastHTML snippet as output.  
This may help us reach yet another goal:

- "Prompt to FastHTML" ‚Üê in plain English: make a website

Don't get me wrong, many "no code" tools are absolute rubbish (mere prompt injection wrapping some LLM), and the few that work are incredibly narrow in actual scope, beyond the fancy GUIs. However, we can indeed narrow the problem down‚Äîe.g., aim to generate custom components, from a known set of prototypes, and simply organize them properly on the page. Even just that could reduce friction immensely from backend work to live web prototype, as informing existing components requires virtually no skill (unlike setting up all the boilerplate and wiring, however minimalist the library).

The reason why I think FastHTML lends itself impeccably well to reach great results with *less*-code LLM assistants is threefold:

- Lean and mean codebase, a simple direct mapping of HTML: as narrow a scope as it could ever get to make web things in Python.
- All batteries included are straightforward as well, with sane *great defaults* ([HTMX](https://htmx.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/), mirroring the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) syntax‚Ä¶)
- Underlying "[Hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/)" paradigm is deemed sound and *elegant* by many great programmers. (who am I to know any better)




### Other CSS frameworks

First of all, *be my guest!* :¬†) The more, the merrier‚Ä¶ 

There are great candidates ‚Äî Material etc. Classes won't directly transfer, so maybe we should make a classless skeleton for all HTML tags, or abstract classes generally and then translate for each CSS at hand.
